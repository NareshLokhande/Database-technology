Exercise : 3

1.Write a program containing a loop that iterates from 1 to 1000 using a variable I,
which is incremented each time around the loop. The program should output the
value of I every hundred iterations (i.e., the output should be 100, 200, etc.)

Output table : create table temp_pl3_1(Output int);

Code :
	delimiter //
	create procedure numeveryhundred()
	/*This loop will iterate from 1 to 1000*/
	begin
		declare i int default 1;
		while i <= 1000 do
			if i % 100 = 0 then
				insert into temp_pl3_1 values(i);
			end if;
		set i = i+1;
		end while;
	end //
	delimiter ;

call : call numeveryhundred();

Output : 
	select * from temp_pl3_1;
	+--------+
	| Output |
	+--------+
	|    100 |
	|    200 |
	|    300 |
	|    400 |
	|    500 |
	|    600 |
	|    700 |
	|    800 |
	|    900 |
	|   1000 |
	+--------+
	
2. Write a program that examines all the numbers from 1 to 999, displaying all 
those for which the sum of the cubes of the digits equal the number itself.

3. Write a program that Selects from any table a minimum and maximum value for a
radius, along with an increment factor, and generates a series of radii by repeatedly
adding the increment to the minimum until the maximum is reached. For each value
of the radius, compute and display the circumference, area, and volume of the
sphere. (Be sure to include both the maximum and the minimum values.).

4. A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same forward and backward, such as
level, radar, etc. Write a program to Selects from any table a five letter word and
determine whether it is a palindrome.

5. Modify the above program to Select from any table a variable length word. This
requires determining how many characters are read in.
