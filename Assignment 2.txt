    Primary key should be something which doesn’t change and does not have a null value.
    
2. What is the 4th column of the Customers table?
    
    Rating is the 4th column
    
3. What is another word for row? For column?
    
    Column is also known  Attribute
    Row is also known as Tuple, Entity
    
4. Why isn’t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
    - When you `INSERT` into a table, wherever it finds the free space in the DB Server HD, it will store the row there
    - When you `SELECT` from a table, the order Of rows in the output
    depends on the row address; it will always be in ascending order of row address
    - Therefore it is not possible to see the first 'N' rows or last 'N'
    rows of a table
